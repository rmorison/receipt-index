# Server Deployment

Take a clean Ubuntu box to an unattended receipt-index service: Postgres in Docker, `receipt-index ingest` on a 15-minute schedule, receipts and nightly database dumps mirrored to Dropbox.

This is the canonical operations document for the always-on deployment — provisioning, first-launch gates, the one-time cutover from the dev machine, weekly monitoring, upgrades, and disaster recovery.

> **Not this document:** [Production Setup](production-setup.md) describes running against a native PostgreSQL server on the dev machine. That is the arrangement this deployment replaces.

## 1. Overview and layout

One Docker Compose project, named `receipt-index` (set by `name:` at the top of `deploy/docker-compose.yml`), with two services:

| Service | What it is |
|---|---|
| `db` | `postgres:18`, named volume `pgdata`, published on `127.0.0.1:15432` only |
| `scheduler` | The app image with `supercronic /app/crontab` as its entrypoint — ingest every 15 min, two rclone mirror lines, one nightly `pg_dump` |

**The git clone is the deployment unit.** There is no registry and no CI: the image is built on the server from the checkout, and deploying an update is `git pull` + rebuild. Everything the server needs beyond the clone is a handful of git-ignored files at the clone root.

Documented clone location: **`~/receipt-index`**, in the home directory of the login user you SSH in as. That user should be uid/gid 1000, which is also the image's `appuser` — so the bind-mounted directories need no `sudo` to manage and files written by the container are readable by you. `/srv/receipt-index` works equally well if you prefer a system location; every command below is run from the clone root, so only the `cd` changes, but you will need `sudo` for the `chown` steps.

Layout after provisioning:

```
~/receipt-index/                 <- clone root; all compose commands run from here
├── .env                         <- secrets (git-ignored, chmod 600)
├── data/
│   ├── receipts/                <- rendered PDF tree      (uid 1000)
│   └── backups/                 <- nightly pg_dump files  (uid 1000)
├── rclone-config/               <- Dropbox token          (uid 1000, chmod 700)
└── deploy/
    ├── docker-compose.yml       <- the production compose file
    ├── crontab                  <- supercronic schedule
    ├── backup.sh                <- nightly dump script
    ├── example.receipt-index.yaml  <- config template (copy + edit, see 3.2b)
    ├── receipt-index.yaml       <- your copy (git-ignored; no secrets, only ${VAR})
    ├── db-init/01-create-roles.sh
    ├── example.env
    └── rclone-setup.md
```

Compose resolves relative paths against the directory holding the compose file, so `deploy/docker-compose.yml` refers to the four state directories with a `../` prefix (`../.env`, `../data/receipts`, `../data/backups`, `../rclone-config`) and to its own siblings with `./`. That is why `.env` belongs at the **clone root** and not in `deploy/`.

Every command in this document assumes:

```bash
cd ~/receipt-index
```

and uses the explicit `-f deploy/docker-compose.yml` form, so the repo-root `docker-compose.yml` (the dev stack: db + GreenMail) is never picked up by accident.

Laptop-side commands use **`receipt-server`** as the SSH target. Either define that alias in `~/.ssh/config` (recommended — the search wrapper defaults to it) or substitute your server's hostname wherever it appears.

---

## 2. Server prerequisites

- **Docker Engine + the Compose v2 plugin.** Install from Docker's own apt repository, not the distro `docker.io` package (which lags and does not ship `docker compose`).

  ```bash
  docker --version
  docker compose version        # must print "Docker Compose version v2..." or newer
  ```

- **Docker enabled at boot** — everything about reboot survival depends on this, because the containers' `restart: unless-stopped` policies only apply once the daemon is running:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable --now docker
  systemctl is-enabled docker   # must print "enabled"
  ```

- **The deploy user in the `docker` group** (`sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`, then log out and back in), so `docker compose` and the SSH search wrapper work without `sudo`.

- **Outbound network**: HTTPS/443 to `api.anthropic.com`, `www.googleapis.com`, `api.dropboxapi.com` and `content.dropboxapi.com`, plus **IMAPS/993** to your IMAP provider. No inbound ports are needed; the database is published on loopback only.

- **`git`, `make`, `curl`** — `make migrate-up` downloads golang-migrate into `.bin/` with curl.

- **`uv`** ([docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)) — only for Gate A, which runs the in-container render tests from the repo's test suite. Skip it if you accept the manual fallback in Gate A.

- **Disk**: the pgdata volume, the receipt tree, seven database dumps, and capped container logs (10 MB × 7 per service). A few GB is plenty; check with `df -h` before starting.

## 3. Provisioning

### 3.1 Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rmorison/receipt-index.git ~/receipt-index
cd ~/receipt-index
```

### 3.2 Create `.env` at the clone root

```bash
cp deploy/example.env .env
chmod 600 .env
```

`deploy/example.env` documents every variable. Real values come from 1Password (`.env` is git-ignored and is never committed):

| Variable | Source |
|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Generate: `openssl rand -hex 24` |
| `RECEIPT_INDEX_PASSWORD` | Generate: `openssl rand -hex 24` — must match the password inside `DATABASE_URL` |
| `IMAP_PASSWORD` | 1Password — your IMAP mailbox item |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | 1Password (Personal) — *Anthropic receipt-index api key* |
| `GDRIVE_TOKEN_JSON` | Output of `receipt-index auth gdrive --client-credentials <client_secret.json>`, run on the laptop |

### 3.2b Create the server app config

```bash
cp deploy/example.receipt-index.yaml deploy/receipt-index.yaml
```

Edit the copy (it is git-ignored) with your real source definitions: IMAP host, username, and folder, and the Google Drive folder id. Secrets stay as `${VAR}` references into `.env`.

`GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` is **not** required on the server. The template deliberately drops that key from the gdrive source, and the OAuth client id/secret needed for refresh already live inside `GDRIVE_TOKEN_JSON`. (The dev config may still interpolate it; do not copy that line over.)

Also do **not** set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` in the server `.env`. The image bakes `/ms-playwright`; the dev value (`.playwright`) is a relative path that does not exist in the container, and if it leaks in, every HTML receipt fails to render and is permanently dead-lettered.

### 3.3 The `$`-in-secrets hazard — read before pasting a password

Docker Compose performs variable expansion on values inside an `env_file`. **A secret containing `$` is silently corrupted.** Verified behaviour: a value written as

```
IMAP_PASSWORD=ab$wcd$$ef
```

is delivered to the container as `ab$ef` — `$wcd` expands to the empty string (compose only mutters `The "wcd" variable is not set` on stderr) and `$$` collapses to a literal `$`. Authentication then fails with an error that says nothing about the real cause. `make`, which also reads this file, has the same hazard.

Rules:

- Escape every literal dollar sign by doubling it: `ab$wcd` → `ab$$wcd`.
- Applies to `IMAP_PASSWORD`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, both Postgres passwords, and the passwords embedded in `DATABASE_URL` / `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`.
- Generate the Postgres passwords from an alphanumeric alphabet (`openssl rand -hex 24`) so the question never comes up for those.

Two checks. First, no expansion warnings at all:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml config --quiet     # must print nothing
```

Second — the check that actually proves it, because a *defined* variable expands silently with no warning — compare the value **as the container sees it** against 1Password, hashed so nothing is printed:

```bash
# In the container (uid 1000, real .env, real compose expansion):
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint sh scheduler \
    -c 'printf %s "$IMAP_PASSWORD" | sha256sum'

# On the laptop, from 1Password (adjust the field reference to the item):
op read "op://Personal/<your-imap-item>/password" | tr -d '\n' | sha256sum
```

The two digests must match. Repeat for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Do this **before** Gate D — a corrupted key surfaces there as an opaque auth failure.

### 3.4 Create the bind-mount directories *before* the first `up -d`

Docker creates a missing bind-mount source as an empty directory owned by `root:root`. The container runs as uid 1000 and cannot write to it — and a store-write failure dead-letters receipts exactly like a render gap does. Create them first:

```bash
mkdir -p data/receipts data/backups rclone-config
chown -R 1000:1000 data/receipts data/backups rclone-config   # sudo if not your uid
chmod 700 rclone-config                                        # holds a standing Dropbox refresh token
```

`chmod 700` on `rclone-config/` is not decoration: `rclone.conf` contains a long-lived Dropbox refresh token with write access to the mirror.

### 3.5 One-time rclone/Dropbox authorization

Follow **[deploy/rclone-setup.md](../../deploy/rclone-setup.md)**: create a dedicated Dropbox app (own client ID — the shared rclone ID is rate-limited during a bulk mirror), enable the four scopes *before* authorizing, run `rclone config` on the laptop, then `scp -r` the config **directory** to `~/receipt-index/rclone-config` and re-apply the ownership and mode above.

The mount is a whole directory, read-write, on purpose: Dropbox access tokens expire in about four hours and rclone refreshes them by writing a temp file and renaming it over `rclone.conf`. A `:ro` mount or a single-file bind mount breaks the rename and the mirror dies silently a few hours after a deploy that looked fine.

---

## 4. Build and migrate

### 4.1 Build the image on the server

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml build
```

This tags `receipt-index:latest` (the compose `image: receipt-index` key), which is what Gate A's tests look for by default.

### 4.2 Start only the database

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d db
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml ps          # db must reach "healthy"
```

The scheduler stays down. **Starting the scheduler is what enables the schedule**, and that is the last thing that happens on launch day (see Gate G). Everything before then runs as one-off `docker compose run --rm` commands.

On first boot of an empty volume, `deploy/db-init/01-create-roles.sh` runs once and creates the `receipt_index` login role (owner of the database and of schema `public`) plus the three NOLOGIN grant-target roles the migrations reference by name (`receipt_index_dev_all` / `_write` / `_read`). It never runs again — a later role change is an `ALTER ROLE`, by hand.

### 4.3 Apply migrations — an explicit deploy step

Migrations are **not** run by the container. They are a deliberate host-side step, before the scheduler ever starts, and again after every upgrade.

Set `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` in `.env`. It connects over the loopback-published host port, and it **must already contain a `?` query parameter** — the Makefile appends `&x-migrations-table=...` to whatever you give it, so a URL without `?sslmode=disable` is malformed and golang-migrate fails to connect:

```
MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://receipt_index:<RECEIPT_INDEX_PASSWORD>@127.0.0.1:15432/receipt_index?sslmode=disable
```

**Run migrations as the `receipt_index` role, not as the superuser.** `receipt_index` owns the database and schema `public` (via `db-init`), and the cutover dump restores every object owned by `receipt_index`. If migrations run as `postgres`, a freshly built server ends up with schema `receipt` and its tables owned by the superuser while a restored server has them owned by the app role — two servers with divergent ownership from the same repo. The app role has everything it needs: `pg_trgm` is a *trusted* extension in Postgres 13+, so the database owner can `CREATE EXTENSION` without superuser.

> `deploy/example.env` ships this line with the `receipt_index` role already in place — migrations run as the database owner, not the superuser. The superuser credentials (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`) are still needed separately for the cutover `pg_restore` (section 6).

Then:

```bash
make migrate-up
```

The Makefile auto-exports `.env`, downloads golang-migrate v4.18.3 into `.bin/` if absent, and applies both migration directories with separate version tables (`schema_migrations_public`, `schema_migrations_receipt`) — both directories start at `000001`, so a shared table would corrupt the state.

---

## 5. First-launch Go/No-Go gates

Run these in order. **Each is a hard stop**: do not proceed to the next gate until the current one passes.

The ordering is not ceremony. Failed items land in `ingest_log` and are then permanently skipped — the idempotency check is the union of `receipts.source_id` and `ingest_log.source_id`, and nothing ever retries a dead-lettered item. A launch-day environmental failure (missing browser, unwritable mount, bad credential) therefore does not present as an outage; it presents as **receipts that silently never appear**, one per message the scheduler touched while broken. So the 15-minute schedule on real mail is enabled **last**, after everything it depends on has been proven.

### Gate A — rendering works in the server-built image

Both render engines must work *in the image built on this server*, as uid 1000.

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
RECEIPT_INDEX_IMAGE=receipt-index:latest \
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_docker_render.py -m integration --no-cov
```

**Pass:** all tests green. That covers Playwright/Chromium rendering an HTML receipt, weasyprint rendering a text receipt (which proves the pango/gdk-pixbuf system libraries are present), `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` resolving to the image's baked `/ms-playwright` even when the host value is poisoned, and `supercronic` / `rclone` / `pg_dump` all being on `PATH` — with `pg_dump` reporting version 18 (an older client cannot dump a v18 server). Every script asserts `os.getuid() == 1000` internally.

If the tests skip, the image tag is wrong — `docker image inspect receipt-index:latest`.

*Without uv on the server*, the minimum manual equivalent:

```bash
docker run --rm --shm-size=1g --entrypoint python receipt-index:latest -c '
import os
from receipt_index.renderer import _html_to_pdf_playwright
assert os.getuid() == 1000
pdf = _html_to_pdf_playwright("<html><body><h1>smoke</h1></body></html>")
assert pdf[:5] == b"%PDF-"
print("playwright OK", len(pdf))'
```

but prefer the test file — it is the version that stays in sync with the code.

### Gate B — platform

```bash
# 1. Compose file lints and every referenced variable resolves
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml config --quiet

# 2. Database is healthy
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml ps

# 3. pgdata is on the volume mounted at /var/lib/postgresql (NOT a subdirectory)
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml exec db \
    sh -c 'echo "$PGDATA"; ls -d "$PGDATA"'

# 4. Sentinel write as uid 1000 to both writable mounts
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint sh scheduler -c '
    id -u
    touch /app/data/receipts/.sentinel && rm /app/data/receipts/.sentinel
    touch /app/data/backups/.sentinel  && rm /app/data/backups/.sentinel
    touch /app/.rclone/.sentinel       && rm /app/.rclone/.sentinel
    echo ALL-MOUNTS-WRITABLE'
```

**Pass:** (1) prints nothing at all — any `variable is not set` warning is a broken `.env`; (2) `db` shows `healthy`; (3) `PGDATA` is `/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker`, i.e. *inside* the volume mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql` — if the volume were mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql/data` instead, the cluster would live outside the volume and vanish on the next container restart; (4) prints `1000` then `ALL-MOUNTS-WRITABLE`.

A host-side `ls -l` is **not** a substitute for step 4. Only a write from inside the container as uid 1000 proves the thing that matters.

### Gate C — schema

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint sh scheduler -c '
    psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT '\''public'\'' AS dir, version, dirty FROM schema_migrations_public
                             UNION ALL
                             SELECT '\''receipt'\'', version, dirty FROM schema_migrations_receipt;"'
```

**Pass — record these numbers in your deploy notes:**

| Migration table | Expected version | dirty |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_migrations_public` | `1` | `f` |
| `schema_migrations_receipt` | `7` | `f` |

(As of 2026-08-01. A `dirty = t` means a migration aborted half-applied; fix it before anything else touches the database.)

Then prove the **application** read path — same role, same DSN, same container the scheduler will use:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint receipt-index scheduler \
    search --vendor zzz-no-such-vendor --output json
```

**Pass:** exit 0 and `[]` on a pre-cutover (empty) database. This is the check that catches an ownership/grant lockout — the failure mode where the schema is perfect and the app still cannot read it.

### Gate D — environment and credentials, with zero writes

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint receipt-index scheduler \
    ingest --dry-run
```

One clean dry run proves three things at once: the config loader resolved every `${VAR}` in `deploy/receipt-index.yaml` (a missing one hard-fails and lists *all* of them), IMAP authenticated, and the Google Drive token refreshed — all with no database writes, no rendering, and therefore no dead-letter exposure.

> **Not a hang.** On an empty database the dry run enumerates the *entire* historical mailbox, because nothing is known yet. It is slow and extremely log-heavy. Let it finish. (This is issue #36's O(N) enumeration; after cutover it is fast again because the union of known `source_id`s is populated.)

**Pass:** exits 0, having listed the candidate items.

### Gate E — cutover parity and DLQ baseline

Perform **[section 6](#6-cutover-from-the-dev-machine-one-time)** in full, including every verification query.

**Pass:** the distinct `source_id` union count on the server equals the value captured from the source at dump time; the per-status `ingest_log` breakdown is recorded in your deploy notes as the monitoring baseline; every `pdf_path` resolves to a file.

### Gate F — Dropbox

```bash
# Remote listing as uid 1000, through the mounted config directory
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint rclone scheduler \
    lsd dropbox: --config /app/.rclone/rclone.conf

# Initial bulk mirror (post-cutover: the full historical tree)
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint rclone scheduler \
    copy /app/data/receipts dropbox:receipt-index/receipts \
    --config /app/.rclone/rclone.conf -v

# Count parity
find data/receipts -type f | wc -l
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint rclone scheduler \
    size dropbox:receipt-index/receipts --config /app/.rclone/rclone.conf
```

**Pass:** `lsd` succeeds as uid 1000, the bulk copy completes with no `too_many_requests` errors in its output (if you see them, the remote is using rclone's shared client ID — redo `deploy/rclone-setup.md` step 1), and the Dropbox object count equals the server file count.

The bulk mirror is the real stress case, not the one-new-file case, and it must pass **before** the scheduler starts: `rclone copy` is additive and never deletes, so a mirror of a bad cutover does not self-clean.

### Gate G — supervised cycle, then the schedule

```bash
# 1. One supervised cycle, watched end to end
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint receipt-index scheduler \
    ingest --limit 1
```

Note the `--entrypoint receipt-index`: the service's entrypoint is `supercronic /app/crontab`, so a bare `run scheduler receipt-index ingest` would append the CLI as *arguments to supercronic*. Once the scheduler is running, `exec` is the more convenient form (`exec` ignores the entrypoint):

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml exec scheduler receipt-index ingest --limit 1
```

**Pass:** exit 0, a PDF appears under `data/receipts`, the corresponding `receipts` row exists, and `receipt-index failures` shows nothing new.

```bash
# 2. Enable the schedule — this starts supercronic and all four cron lines
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d

# 3. Watch two automatic ticks (at :00/:15/:30/:45)
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml logs -f scheduler
```

**Pass, after two automatic ticks:**

- Zero duplicate `source_id` processing — the first-cycle duplicate query in [section 6.6](#66-verification-queries) still returns `0`.
- No `ingest_log` growth in `failed` or `skipped` beyond the recorded baseline.
- A sync tick (`:07/:22/:37/:52`) mirrors any new file to Dropbox.

While you are here, **record the exact log strings** for a non-zero ingest exit and for supercronic's "falling behind" warning — those literal strings are what the weekly log scan in [section 7](#7-weekly-monitoring) greps for.

```bash
# 4. Reboot test, against the final configuration
sudo reboot
# ... then, after it comes back:
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml ps        # both services up
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml logs --since 20m scheduler
```

**Pass:** both services return without human intervention and a scheduled tick fires. See [section 7](#7-weekly-monitoring) about the one expected failed tick immediately after a reboot.

---

## 6. Cutover from the dev machine (one-time)

Moves the existing receipt corpus — database rows *and* the rendered PDF tree — from the dev machine's native PostgreSQL 18 (port 5435, database `receipt_index`) to the server. Run it as Gate E, with the scheduler still down.

`ingest_log` is **load-bearing data, not "just a log"**: idempotency is the union of `receipts.source_id` and `ingest_log.source_id`. If only `receipts` made it across, every historically skipped or failed item would be reprocessed — LLM spend, and previously-skipped items may now insert under model drift.

No sequence resync is needed: there are no sequences, `serial`, or identity columns in either schema (UUID v7 defaults throughout).

### 6.1 Preconditions

- [ ] **The server database is empty.** If Gates B–D touched it (they do: `make migrate-up` creates the migration tables), drop and recreate before restoring — `pg_restore` into a schema that already exists collides on everything.
- [ ] **Proven, not assumed:** immediately before the drop, the server's `ingest_log` has **zero rows** (see 6.3). "The scheduler was never up" is a claim; zero rows is evidence.
- [ ] **The rsync target is empty.** `find data/receipts -type f | wc -l` on the server returns `0`. An additive rsync over leftovers strands orphan PDFs: filenames embed the LLM-extracted vendor, and extraction is not deterministic enough for names to collide cleanly.
- [ ] Gates A–D have passed.

### 6.2 Enforce the laptop stop

Not a habit — a lock. Rename the laptop's config so an absent-minded `receipt-index ingest` cannot connect to anything:

```bash
cd /path/to/receipt-index   # your laptop clone
mv .env .env.retired-$(date +%Y%m%d)
mv receipt-index.yaml receipt-index.yaml.retired-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

Take the dump **strictly after** the last laptop run has completed.

Capture the source-of-truth number *from the source*, at dump time:

```bash
psql "postgresql://receipt_index@localhost:5435/receipt_index" -At -c "
    SELECT count(*) FROM (
        SELECT source_id FROM receipt.receipts
        UNION
        SELECT source_id FROM receipt.ingest_log
    ) AS known;"
```

Write that number down. It is the single strongest cutover check.

### 6.3 Dump

```bash
pg_dump --format=custom --no-password \
    --file=~/receipt-index-cutover-$(date +%Y%m%d).dump \
    "postgresql://receipt_index@localhost:5435/receipt_index"
```

**Retain this file. It is *the* rollback artifact.** If the cutover is aborted, re-restore from this same dump — never take a second dump (by then the laptop database may have drifted, and a fresh dump would launder the very state you are rolling back from).

Copy it to the server:

```bash
scp ~/receipt-index-cutover-*.dump receipt-server:~/
```

On the server, prove emptiness, then drop and recreate:

```bash
cd ~/receipt-index

# Evidence of "paused": both must be 0
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint sh scheduler -c '
    psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT
        (SELECT count(*) FROM receipt.receipts)   AS receipts,
        (SELECT count(*) FROM receipt.ingest_log) AS ingest_log;"'

# Fresh, empty, owned by the app role.
# db-init only runs on first boot of an empty volume, so the database-level
# bits it applied must be re-applied by hand here. The roles are cluster-level
# and survive a DROP DATABASE.
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml exec db sh -c '
    psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname postgres -c "DROP DATABASE $POSTGRES_DB;"
    psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE $POSTGRES_DB OWNER receipt_index;"
    psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname "$POSTGRES_DB" -c "
        GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE $POSTGRES_DB TO receipt_index_dev_all, receipt_index_dev_write, receipt_index_dev_read;
        ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO receipt_index;"'
```

### 6.4 Restore

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml cp \
    ~/receipt-index-cutover-<date>.dump db:/tmp/cutover.dump

docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml exec db sh -c '
    pg_restore --exit-on-error --verbose \
        --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname "$POSTGRES_DB" /tmp/cutover.dump'
```

**Without `--no-owner` and without `--no-acl`** — both omissions are deliberate:

- `--no-owner` would leave every object owned by the superuser, and the application (connecting as `receipt_index`) would be running on objects it does not own. The dump's `ALTER ... OWNER TO receipt_index` statements succeed precisely because `db-init` pre-created that role.
- `--no-acl` would drop the column-level grants the migrations issue; the only ACLs in the dump target the three `receipt_index_dev_*` roles, which exist.

The dump also carries the `pg_trgm` extension and **both** `schema_migrations_*` tables at their source versions (public `1`, receipt `7` as of 2026-08-01), which is what makes the next step a no-op rather than a re-run.

```bash
make migrate-up
```

**Expect "no change".** If it applies anything, that is a genuine post-v7 migration added in the repo since the laptop last migrated — which is the correct ordering for it to be applied in.

Re-run the Gate C queries: same expected versions, `dirty = f`.

### 6.5 Files

```bash
# On the laptop — -c compares by checksum, not size+mtime
rsync -av -c --info=progress2 \
    /path/to/receipt-index/data/receipts/ \
    receipt-server:receipt-index/data/receipts/

# Counts must match
find /path/to/receipt-index/data/receipts -type f | wc -l   # laptop
ssh receipt-server 'find ~/receipt-index/data/receipts -type f | wc -l'             # server
```

Then on the server:

```bash
chown -R 1000:1000 data/receipts      # sudo if not your uid
```

The database stores paths **relative to the store root**, so the tree transplants with no database rewriting.

### 6.6 Verification queries

Run these **as the app role over the app DSN** — that is, inside the container, using `$DATABASE_URL`. Running them as the superuser would pass even when the application is locked out by ownership or grants, which is the exact failure class these are here to catch.

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint sh scheduler -c 'psql "$DATABASE_URL"'
```

**1. Distinct `source_id` union — the strongest single number.** Must equal the value captured in 6.2:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM (
    SELECT source_id FROM receipt.receipts
    UNION
    SELECT source_id FROM receipt.ingest_log
) AS known;
```

**2. Per-table counts** — compare against the laptop:

```sql
SELECT 'receipts' AS relation, count(*) FROM receipt.receipts
UNION ALL
SELECT 'ingest_log', count(*) FROM receipt.ingest_log;
```

**3. Per-status `ingest_log` breakdown — RECORD THIS. It is the monitoring baseline** for [section 7](#7-weekly-monitoring):

```sql
SELECT status, count(*) FROM receipt.ingest_log GROUP BY status ORDER BY status;
```

> `receipts` ≫ `ingest_log` is **expected**, not a defect: receipts ingested before the dead-letter log existed have no log rows at all. Do not "fix" it.

**4. Schema integrity** — a partially-errored restore can leave the counts right and the indexes silently missing:

```sql
SELECT extname, extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_trgm';

SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'receipt' AND indexname = 'idx_receipts_vendor';
```

Both must return exactly one row (`idx_receipts_vendor` is the GIN trigram index on `vendor` that every `search --vendor` depends on).

**5. Referential file check** — every `pdf_path` resolves to a real file. Run it in the container, where the store is mounted:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint sh scheduler -c '
    psql "$DATABASE_URL" -At -c "SELECT pdf_path FROM receipt.receipts" \
    | while IFS= read -r p; do
          [ -f "/app/data/receipts/$p" ] || echo "MISSING $p"
      done | tee /tmp/missing.txt | wc -l'
```

**Must be `0`.** Orphans (files with no row) are counted separately and are tolerable:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint sh scheduler -c '
    psql "$DATABASE_URL" -At -c "SELECT pdf_path FROM receipt.receipts" | sort > /tmp/db.txt
    ( cd /app/data/receipts && find . -type f | sed "s|^\./||" ) | sort > /tmp/fs.txt
    echo "orphan files: $(comm -13 /tmp/db.txt /tmp/fs.txt | wc -l)"'
```

**6. First-cycle duplicate check** — run after Gate G's first automatic ticks. Duplicates cannot appear as double rows (`uq_receipts_source_id` forbids it); they appear as *fresh log rows for old items*. Substitute the cutover timestamp:

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM receipt.ingest_log l
JOIN receipt.receipts r ON r.source_id = l.source_id
WHERE l.created_at > TIMESTAMPTZ '2026-08-01 00:00:00+00'   -- cutover mark
  AND r.created_at < TIMESTAMPTZ '2026-08-01 00:00:00+00';
```

**Must be `0`.**

**7. End-to-end, from the laptop** — a known historical receipt is searchable and viewable through the SSH wrapper (see [section 9](#9-searching-from-the-laptop)):

```bash
scripts/receipt-search search --vendor "Southern California Edison"
scripts/receipt-search show <one-of-those-ids>
```

### 6.7 Finish

Proceed to Gate F (Dropbox bulk mirror, count-verified) and only then Gate G. Do not start the scheduler earlier: bringing it up activates *all four* cron lines at once — ingest, both mirrors, and the nightly backup. If you need the scheduler running with the mirror still off, comment out the two `rclone` lines in `deploy/crontab` locally (leave the edit uncommitted) and restore them after Gate F.

### 6.8 Abort criterion

**The point of no return is the first server cycle that ingests genuinely new mail.**

Before that point — rollback:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml stop scheduler
# drop + recreate the database exactly as in 6.3, then re-restore
# from the SAME retained dump file (6.4). Never take a fresh dump.
```

Then restore the laptop's `.env` / `receipt-index.yaml` from their `.retired-*` names.

After that point, the laptop database is stale: recovery is a *reverse cutover* (dump the server, restore to the laptop), not a rollback. The Dropbox mirror is additive and needs no unwinding in either case.

### 6.9 Retiring the dev PostgreSQL

Keep the dev cluster's `receipt_index` database until the server has earned it. Explicit criterion — **7 consecutive days** of:

- zero growth in `failed` and `skipped` `ingest_log` counts beyond the baseline,
- no supercronic falling-behind warnings,
- Dropbox/server file-count parity holding.

Then, and only then:

```bash
# The ONLY irreversible step in this plan. Take a final dump first.
pg_dump --format=custom --file=~/receipt-index-final-$(date +%Y%m%d).dump \
    "postgresql://receipt_index@localhost:5435/receipt_index"
# Store it somewhere durable, verify it is non-empty, and only then:
psql -p 5435 -c 'DROP DATABASE receipt_index;'
```

## 7. Weekly monitoring

Solo-operator routine. Five minutes, once a week.

### 7.1 Per-status `ingest_log` breakdown vs. the recorded baseline

The important one, and the reason it is not just `receipt-index failures`:

**`receipt-index failures` filters `status = 'failed'` only.** A receipt the LLM scored below the confidence threshold is logged as **`skipped`**, the cycle exits **0**, nothing appears in `failures` — and the item is dead-lettered forever, because idempotency counts `ingest_log` rows regardless of status. That is the silent half of the data-loss surface, and it has real precedent in this project (the `amount: 0` saga; payment confirmations not recognized as receipts).

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml exec scheduler sh -c '
    psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT status, count(*) FROM receipt.ingest_log
                             GROUP BY status ORDER BY status;"'
```

Compare all three numbers against the Gate E baseline. `success` growing is normal. **`skipped` or `failed` growing needs eyeballs:**

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml exec scheduler sh -c '
    psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
        SELECT created_at, source_type, source_id, email_sender, email_subject, error_message
        FROM receipt.ingest_log
        WHERE status = '\''skipped'\''
          AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '\''8 days'\''
        ORDER BY created_at DESC;"'
```

Read the senders and subjects. A genuine non-receipt is fine. A real receipt in that list means the extraction threshold or prompt needs work — and recovering it requires deleting its `ingest_log` row (see [section 8.2](#82-dlq-recovery)).

Swap `'skipped'` for `'failed'` for the failure side, where `error_message` is populated.

*Future work:* a `receipt-index failures --status skipped` flag, so this stops being a raw SQL step.

### 7.2 Log scan

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml logs --since 168h scheduler \
    | grep -Ei 'level=error|job failed|behind|Traceback'
```

Grep for the exact strings recorded during Gate G; the pattern above is the broad net.

Two things to know:

- **One failed ingest tick immediately after every reboot is expected.** Container restart policies do not honour `depends_on` health ordering, so the scheduler can fire its first tick while Postgres is still starting. The run aborts on connection failure *before* any item is processed, so it writes no `ingest_log` rows and dead-letters nothing; the next tick self-heals. A *second* consecutive failure is not expected.
- **Falling-behind warnings** mean a cycle outran its 15-minute interval. supercronic's no-overlap guarantee holds (it will not start an overlapping run), so nothing is corrupted — but this is the early-warning signal for issue #36's O(N) mailbox enumeration, and the cue to revisit the cadence.

### 7.3 Dropbox freshness

From any device, no SSH: check the newest file under `receipt-index/receipts` in Dropbox. This is the free end-to-end delivery check — it exercises ingest, rendering, the store, and the mirror in one look.

Read it correctly: a fresh file **confirms** delivery. The *absence* of new files is not a health signal, because it is the normal state during a quiet week. Only chase it when you know receipts arrived in the window.

Also glance at `receipt-index/backups`: seven files, day-of-week names, the newest dated last night.

### 7.4 Disk

```bash
df -h /
du -sh ~/receipt-index/data/*
```

Container logs are capped (10 MB × 7 files per service) and the backup directory is bounded at seven dumps by day-of-week rotation, so growth should be dominated by the receipt tree and pgdata.

### 7.5 Future work

A dead-man's-snitch (healthchecks.io-style) ping as a fourth crontab line after each successful cycle. Absence-of-ping covers crash-loop, falling-behind, and config breakage in one mechanism — and unlike everything above, it pages *you* instead of waiting to be checked.

## 8. Routine operations

### 8.1 Upgrade

```bash
cd ~/receipt-index
git pull
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml build

# Stop the scheduler BEFORE `up -d` recreates it.
# Recreation kills the container; a cycle interrupted between writing a PDF and
# committing its row leaves an orphan file behind. Check for an in-flight cycle
# first — ticks land on :00/:15/:30/:45 and normally finish in well under a
# minute, so there is a wide idle window.
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml exec scheduler pgrep -af 'receipt-index ingest' || echo "idle"
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml stop scheduler

# Migrations before the new code runs (the db service stays up throughout)
make migrate-up

docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml logs -f scheduler
```

Rebuild the image on **every** `playwright` version bump — the browser build is pinned per Playwright release, and a mismatch between the pip package and the baked browser breaks HTML rendering (and therefore dead-letters receipts).

After an upgrade that touched the renderer, the Dockerfile, or the config, re-run Gates A–D before walking away.

### 8.2 DLQ recovery

Dead-lettering is permanent by design: a `source_id` present in `ingest_log` is never looked at again, whatever its status. Recovery is deleting the log row so the item becomes unknown again.

Only worth doing for **environmental** causes — a rendering gap, a permissions problem, a network blip, a corrupted credential. Content failures (the LLM genuinely cannot read the document) will simply fail again, and re-running them costs Anthropic spend for nothing.

1. **Fix the cause first.** Re-run the relevant gate to prove it.

2. **Check for an orphaned PDF for that `source_id`.** A failure between rendering and the database write leaves a file with no row; leaving it behind means a duplicate PDF after the retry succeeds:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml exec scheduler sh -c '
       psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
           SELECT source_id, email_subject, error_message, created_at
           FROM receipt.ingest_log WHERE status = '\''failed'\''
           ORDER BY created_at DESC;"'
   # then look for a plausibly-matching file under the vendor/date path:
   ls -l data/receipts/<YYYY>/<MM>/
   ```

3. **Delete the log rows to force a retry.** Scope it — never `DELETE FROM receipt.ingest_log WHERE status = 'failed'` wholesale, which would also resurrect genuine content failures:

   ```sql
   -- Preview first
   SELECT source_id, email_subject, error_message
   FROM receipt.ingest_log
   WHERE status = 'failed'
     AND created_at >= TIMESTAMPTZ '2026-08-01 00:00:00+00'
     AND error_message LIKE '%<the environmental error substring>%';

   -- Then delete exactly those
   DELETE FROM receipt.ingest_log
   WHERE status = 'failed'
     AND created_at >= TIMESTAMPTZ '2026-08-01 00:00:00+00'
     AND error_message LIKE '%<the environmental error substring>%';
   ```

   The same applies to `status = 'skipped'` rows for receipts that should have been recognized.

4. The next scheduled cycle picks them up. Watch it, then re-check the per-status breakdown.

### 8.3 Disaster recovery from Dropbox

The full-loss story: the server is gone and Dropbox holds everything — the nightly dumps under `receipt-index/backups` and the complete receipt tree under `receipt-index/receipts`.

1. Rebuild the host per [section 2](#2-server-prerequisites), then provision per [section 3](#3-provisioning) (clone, `.env` from 1Password, directories with uid 1000, rclone config).

2. `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml build && docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d db`. First boot of the empty volume runs `db-init`, creating the `receipt_index` owner role and the grant-target roles — this must happen **before** the restore, or the dump's `OWNER TO` statements fail and the app is locked out.

3. Pull both trees back:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint rclone scheduler \
       copy dropbox:receipt-index/backups /app/data/backups \
       --config /app/.rclone/rclone.conf -v

   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint rclone scheduler \
       copy dropbox:receipt-index/receipts /app/data/receipts \
       --config /app/.rclone/rclone.conf -v

   ls -l data/backups/          # pick the newest receipt_index-<dow>.dump
   chown -R 1000:1000 data      # sudo if not your uid
   ```

4. Restore into the fresh, empty database — again **without** `--no-owner` and **without** `--no-acl`:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml cp \
       data/backups/receipt_index-<dow>.dump db:/tmp/restore.dump
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml exec db sh -c '
       pg_restore --exit-on-error --verbose \
           --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname "$POSTGRES_DB" /tmp/restore.dump'
   make migrate-up      # no-op, or applies a delta newer than the dump
   ```

5. Re-run Gates A–D and the verification queries in [6.6](#66-verification-queries), then Gate G. Expect to lose at most one day of ingest (the window between the last nightly dump and the loss); those messages are still in the mailbox and will be re-ingested on the next cycles, since their `source_id`s went down with the database.

---

## 9. Searching from the laptop

`scripts/receipt-search` runs the CLI inside the server's scheduler container over SSH and passes every argument straight through:

```bash
scripts/receipt-search search --vendor "Acme Parking (U.S.), LLC"
scripts/receipt-search search --date-from 2026-01-01 --date-to 2026-03-31 --output json
scripts/receipt-search show 019537f1-...-a3
scripts/receipt-search failures
scripts/receipt-search --help
```

Symlink it onto your `PATH` if you use it often:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/receipt-index/scripts/receipt-search ~/bin/receipt-search
```

Environment overrides:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RECEIPT_INDEX_SSH_HOST` | `receipt-server` | SSH target (hostname or `~/.ssh/config` alias) |
| `RECEIPT_INDEX_COMPOSE_PROJECT` | `receipt-index` | Compose project name |
| `RECEIPT_INDEX_SERVICE` | `scheduler` | Service to exec into |

Two details worth knowing when it misbehaves:

- It targets the container by **compose project name** (`docker compose -p receipt-index exec`), not by compose-file path, so it does not care where the repo was cloned on the server. The price is that the project must be **up** — which is the normal state under `restart: unless-stopped`. `no such service: scheduler` means the service is down; SSH in and check `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml ps`.
- Arguments are re-quoted client-side before being handed to SSH, because SSH flattens its argument list into a single string that the remote shell re-parses. That is what keeps `--vendor "Acme Parking (U.S.), LLC"` intact as one argument.

Anything the CLI can do is available this way, including `ingest`, but leave scheduled ingest to supercronic — a manual run that overlaps a scheduled tick is not protected by the no-overlap guarantee (which is per cron line, inside the scheduler).
